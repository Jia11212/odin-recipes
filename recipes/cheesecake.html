    <h1>No-Bake Cheesecake Flag Cake</h1>
    <p>
      That you can make this lovely, sweet treat without turning on the oven is
      probably enough of a reason to give this serious consideration. Besides
      the taste and light mousse-like texture, I think your guests will enjoy
      the iconic stars and stripes design provided by the fresh blueberries and
      strawberries. USA! USA! USA!
